1. Responsiveness:
- Every page is usable on mobile for screens as small as 400px wide and 700px high. Utilised media queries and flex box layouts to allow our code base to be adaptive.

2. Clear and simple navigation menus
- Back buttons on the log in and register pages and a navigation bar on all other pages that shows the dashboard button and a logout button for easy navigation around the webpage.
- Every modal has a close button and can also be exited by clicking off of the modal.
- Landing page is simple with a login and register button only to reduce clutter.
- Login and Register pages have prompts on the bottom that guide users depending on their situation. i.e. Don't have an account? Sign up here, or Already have an account? Log in here. Clickable words allows seemless and intuative transition.

3. Image Labels
- Labels on all of the images so that if the images don't load the user still knows what is supposed to render in the spot.

4. Consistent Branding and Design
- Consistent use of blue, white and black colour scheme across all pages. White space is used effectively on the login and register pages to reduce clutter and improve focus for the user.
- Presto Logo and Image on the landing page makes for a warm welcome for users.

5. Micro-interactions to allow for instant feedback to the user:
- Included hover effects on buttons and draggable items to provide feedback to user that they are interactable
- Edit Thumbnail button is layered over the thumbanil in the deckpage and is visiable upon hover. This is an intuiative edit design.
- Presentation Arrows are blured if there are no more slides to the left or to the right to indicate that the user is at the starting or ending slide. This feedback makes it easy for users to know where they are in the presentation.

6. Content Organisation:
- Use of clear headings, subheadings and boxes are used to section off areas and group together important information / interactables. This reduces clutter and enhances the simplicity of the webpage
- Use of rendered cards on dashboard with essential information such as description, length, title and thumbnail makes seeing all of your presentations more digestable and simple to read.

7. Creative use of empty space by including images and icons
- Filled up empty space with cute images and icons to make sure the user knows the empty space isn't a mistake. For example on the dashboard when there is no presentation cards an image and text is rendered instead.
- On the re-order slides page instructions are given to help users rearrange slides.

8. Confirmation modals for deletion of slides and decks.
- Allows users to double think if they want to delete a slide or deck and ensures they do not accidently delete things.

9. Slide Deck Page:
- Slide is a constant 2/1 ratio so that when users place elements on the slide no matter the view port the elements are consistent.
- Arrow buttons on keyboard allow navigation through slides on edit page and preview page to allow for quicker and easier slide creation / viewing
- Hovering over elements on the slide makes the border thicker, providing feedback to the user about which element they are interacting with and also which element is on a higher layer.

10. Overflow control on all pages that allows users to easily navigate to where they want to be through a scroll bar despite viewport limitations.
