1. Keyboard Accessibility:
- Edit title can be confirmed with enter button
- Presentation Keys can be controlled with arrow keys
- Login and Register pages can be submitted with enter button

2. Colour Contrast
- There is sufficient colour contrasting between the text and the background on all of our pages making the text legible for people with visual impairments or colour blindess.

3. Accessible Forms:
- All form controls have been labeled using <label> elements or the aria-label attribute with descriptive fields.
- Every form either provides error messages through the form itself or opens an error modal providing validation feedback and instructions that make our wepbage more accessible and easy to use.

4. Colour Coding Buttons:
- All delete buttons are associated with a red colour and all create new buttons are associated with a green colour to distinguish clearly between the two actions.
- Each element creation button has an different associated colour to clearly seperate the types of elements that are being created.
- Enable Fade Transition button toggles between green and red depending on which state it is in to give users immediate feedback and help with accessibility.

5. Interactable Buttons:
- Every button is interactiable with either the cursor changing or the button changing style to give users immediate feedback that the button is interactable.
- On important forms the Submit button is disabled until all key information is supplied, guiding the user with instructions and hence making our webpage more accessble.

6. Text alternatives using icons:
- Icons are used where text can be simplified for example, edit title button, edit thumbnail button and clear file on image upload are all replaced by simple edit and trash icons. Close icon is used on all modals. This makes our webpage more accessible for people who have trouble reading.
