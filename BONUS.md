1. Super cool and cute landing page:
- Created a custom Presto Logo and Presto Mascot to sit on the landing page, welcoming users into our webpage to get them in the presentation creation mood.

2. Dashboard Edit Presentation Details and Delete Presentation
- Added a context menu for when users right click on the presentation dashboard cards. Users can choose to either edit the details of the presentation or delete the presentation without having to go into the slide edit page. This is a quality of life thing.

3. Search bar for searching by presentation title on the dashboard.
- Allows users to render only the presentations that they search for which allows them to find their presentation easier and quicker.

4. Edit Title / Edit Thumbnail:
- Have an edit icon next to the title of the presentation that when clicked, allows the user to edit the title in the exact same spot, ontop of the old one. This provides an intuiative way to edit titles. The edit button disappears while editing and when clicked off the title saves and the edit button reappears
- The edit thumbnail button is layered ontop of the thumbnail image, so when users hover over they can see an edit icon appear which is clickable and allows them to edit their thumbnails. Another intuiative way to edit the thumbnail.

5. File upload on edit thumbnail:
- Have a bin icon that allows users to delete the file that they uploaded if they change their mind. This allows user to seemlessly upload photos without having to open and close the modal to reset the fields. The bin icon only renders when a file is uploaded.
